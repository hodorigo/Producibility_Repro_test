    The metacommunity concept is an important way to think about linkages
    between different spatial scales in ecology. Here we review current
    understanding about this concept. We ﬁrst investigate issues related to its
    deﬁnition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of
    multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms
    for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the
    mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different
    processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat
    distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their
    potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the
    concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate
    this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists
    strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work
    across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the
    metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with
    those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on
    local communities alone.
